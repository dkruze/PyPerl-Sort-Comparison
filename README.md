# PyPerl-Sort-Comparison
These two programs perform the same task (bubble sorting some integers,) but are written using two different scripting languages.
These files were created separately using a Perl-compliant BASH terminal (IUPUI Tesla Server) and Python's IDLE editor, but they can be run in one environment
   provided it supports both languages.
I personally recommend a website like Replit.com for running these scripts, but on any system where both languages are supported, they can be run on windows by simply
  double-clicking on the source files in the chosen directory.
On a BASH terminal, they can be run like so:
  PERL:
    perl bubble.pl
  PYTHON:
    python bubble.py
